# Serverless-API
# This is the ReadMe file for the serverless rest API challenge:
There is a package called **functions** which contains two folders, **get** and **post**. 

Each of them has its main function, test functions, and cover files. To get detailed information on the test coverage, you can check out the **cover.html**.

Clone this repo into your Go Path and run tests by **make test** or **go test** in the get or the post directories.
