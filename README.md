# This is the ReadMe file for the serverless rest API challenge:
There is a package called **functions** which contains two folders, **get** and **post**. 

Each of them has its main function, test functions, and cover files. To get detailed information on the test coverage, you can check out the **cover.html**.

### POST:

  "note": "Testing a sensor.",\
  "serial": "D0010245"\
